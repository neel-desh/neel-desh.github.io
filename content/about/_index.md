Hi, I’m Neel — (neovim btw)

I’m a Software Developer who believes in writing clean, scalable, and efficient code. I specialize in building `distributed`, `real-time`, `low-latency systems` that are robust and highly scalable.

I’ve worked closely with multiple teams and stakeholders to deliver impactful solutions. My philosophy is simple — get it done. I focus on identifying inefficiencies and fixing them. Over the years, I’ve learned that building fast and delivering quality are equally essential.
